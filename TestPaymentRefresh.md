# Payment Refresh Test Documentation

## Summary

I've successfully implemented automatic refresh functionality for the PaymentsView when payments are edited. Here's what was added:

### Changes Made

1. **Added Combine import** to PaymentsView for notification handling
2. **Added cancellables property** to store notification subscriptions
3. **Added notification listener** in `onAppear` that listens for `.paymentSaved` notifications

### How It Works

1. When a payment is edited and saved in the PaymentEditWindow:
   - The `PaymentViewModel.updatePayment()` method posts a `.paymentSaved` notification
   - The window closes and calls its completion handler

2. The PaymentsView now has TWO mechanisms for refreshing:
   - **Direct callback**: When opening edit window, it passes a completion handler that calls `viewModel.loadPayments()`
   - **Notification listener**: The view listens for `.paymentSaved` notifications and refreshes automatically

### Code Added to PaymentsView

```swift
import Combine  // Added

struct PaymentsView: View {
    // ... existing properties ...
    @State private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()  // Added
    
    var body: some View {
        // ... existing body ...
        .onAppear {
            viewModel.loadPayments()
            
            // Set up listener for the paymentSaved notification
            NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .paymentSaved)
                .sink { _ in
                    print("ðŸ”§ PaymentsView: Payment saved notification received, reloading payments...")
                    viewModel.loadPayments()
                }
                .store(in: &cancellables)
        }
    }
}
```

### Benefits

- **Redundant refresh mechanisms** ensure the list always updates
- **Works for all payment saves**, not just edits
- **Automatic refresh** without manual intervention
- **Debug logging** to track when refreshes occur

### Testing

To test this implementation:

1. Open the Payments view
2. Right-click on a payment and select "Edit Payment"
3. Make changes (e.g., change from loan repayment to contribution)
4. Click "Save"
5. The payment list should automatically refresh showing the updated information

The console will show:
```
ðŸ”§ PaymentsView: Payment saved notification received, reloading payments...
```

This indicates the notification system is working correctly.
