# Fixing App Icon Display Issues

The app icon has been successfully built into your application. The AppIcon.icns file is present in the app bundle and properly referenced in Info.plist.

## Why the Icon Might Not Show Up

macOS aggressively caches app icons. Even though your new avocado icon is built into the app, the system might still show the old icon.

## Solutions to Make the Icon Appear

### Option 1: Force Icon Cache Refresh (Recommended)
```bash
# Clear the icon cache
sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store
sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices.store -exec rm -rf {} \;
sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm -rf {} \;

# Kill icon services
killall Finder
killall Dock

# Touch the app to update its modification date
touch /Users/bobkitchen/Documents/GitHub/SolidarityFundr/build/Build/Products/Debug/SolidarityFundr.app
```

### Option 2: Move the App
1. Move the built app from the build folder to Applications (or Desktop)
2. Move it back
3. This often triggers an icon refresh

### Option 3: Restart
1. Restart your Mac
2. The icon cache will be rebuilt on startup

### Option 4: Build and Archive
1. In Xcode: Product → Archive
2. Export the app from the Organizer
3. The exported app should show the correct icon

## Verify the Icon is Correct

You can verify your avocado icon is properly built:
```bash
# Check the icon file exists
ls -la /Users/bobkitchen/Documents/GitHub/SolidarityFundr/build/Build/Products/Debug/SolidarityFundr.app/Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns

# Preview the icon
qlmanage -p /Users/bobkitchen/Documents/GitHub/SolidarityFundr/build/Build/Products/Debug/SolidarityFundr.app/Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns
```

## Technical Details

✅ **What's Working:**
- AppIcon.appiconset contains all required icon sizes
- Asset catalog is properly configured
- Build process successfully creates AppIcon.icns
- Info.plist correctly references the icon
- The icon file is 100KB, indicating it contains image data

The issue is purely a display/caching problem on macOS, not a build problem.
